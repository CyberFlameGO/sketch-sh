# A new home

In the last year, [Sketch.sh](https://sketch.sh) has been operating within 
the generous free plans of several hosting services like [now.sh](https://now.sh) and
[Heroku](https://heroku.com). 

As Sketch grown, there are several incidents that leads to service interruptions 
because of the limitation of the free plans. Like:

- [That time when you couldn't save any new Sketches](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/status-of-sketch-sh/3925)
- [Or HackerNews's hug of death](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20217979) that rendered 
Sketch unusable for everyone

These incidents happened because I've been trying to keep the infrastructure cost of Sketch 
as low as possible. This could have been going for a while longer if I didn't receive this email
from Heroku:

Well this is a deal breaker for me. I can't start a new dyno until next month and I decided 
it's time to move on.

## Moving to DigitalOcean

With the financial support from Sketch's generous [Open Collective's backers](https://opencollective.com/sketch-sh), 
I'm pleased to announce that Sketch has a new home. The whole website is currently running on a VPS hosted by DigitalOcean.

Technical details and costs:

### Database

I'm created a new managed PostgreSQL cluster which costs $15/ month. 

This includes a daily backup and 7 days rentention of point-in-time backup 
so I would say this is the cheapest managed PostgreSQL cluster on the market with a relatively reliable hosting service.

### Backend

I created a Docker Swarm cluster on the cheapest VPS plans which costs $5/ month. 
This includes a Traefik reverse proxy, Hasura GraphQL Engine, and the custom authentication server. 

By setting up a Swarm cluster, I can easily add new node in case of a traffic spikes as well as 
reproducible deployments with a single command.

For more details, please refer to [/server folder on Github](https://github.com/Sketch-sh/sketch-sh/tree/master/server).

## Results

Moving to a new host has decreased the average response time of backend by 40% (50ms). This is due to the fact that 
**auth** server and **GraphQL Engine** stays in the same machine.

Here is CPU usage chart over the last few days:

import cpu_chart from "./cpu load.png"

Under the normal loads, CPU usage never exceeds 10 percent which is an amazing result given the cheap $5/ month plan.
